# ImmutableX Core SDK Kotlin/JVM

The Immutable Core SDK Kotlin/JVM provides convenient access to the Immutable API's for applications written on the Immutable X platform.

## Documentation

See the [developer guides](https://docs.x.immutable.com) for information on building on Immutable X.

See the [API reference documentation](https://docs.x.immutable.com/reference) for more information on our API's.

## Installation

1. Create an Access Token [(see here)](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) with `read:packages` enabled.
2. Add the GitHub package as a repository either in your `build.gradle` file or `settings.gradle` if you have one:
```gradle
repositories {
    maven {
        name = "imx-core-sdk-kotlin-jvm"
        url = uri("https://maven.pkg.github.com/immutable/imx-core-sdk-kotlin-jvm")
        credentials {
            username = "<github username>"
            password = "<access token>"
        }
    }
}
```
Note: will look to have this accessible directly via the `mavenCentral()` repository in the future.
3. Add dependency to your app `build.gradle` file:
```gradle
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.immutable.sdk:imx-core-sdk-kotlin-jvm:$version'
}
```
4. Set the correct environment (Ropsten or Production/Mainnet)
```kt
ImmutableXCore.setBase(ImmutableXBase.Ropsten)
```

## Usage

### Standard API Requests

The Core SDK includes classes that interact with the Immutable X APIs.

e.g. Get a list of collections ordered by name in ascending order
```kt
val response = CollectionsApi().getCollections(
    pageSize = 20,
    orderBy = "name",
    direction = "asc"
)
```
View the [OpenAPI spec](openapi.json) for a full list of API requests available in the Core SDK.

## Workflow Functions

Utility functions that will chain necessary API calls to complete a process or perform a transaction.

* Register a user with ImmutableX and returns the Stark key pair
* Buy cryptocurrency via Moonpay
* Buy ERC721
* Sell ERC721
* Cancel listing
* Transfer ERC20/ERC721/ETH

### Wallet Connection

In order to use any workflow functions, you will need to pass in the connected wallet provider. This means you will need to implement your own Wallet L1 [Signer](https://github.com/immutable/imx-core-sdk-kotlin-jvm/blob/main/imx-core-sdk-kotlin-jvm/src/main/kotlin/com/immutable/sdk/Signer.kt) and L2 [StarkSigner](https://github.com/immutable/imx-core-sdk-kotlin-jvm/blob/main/imx-core-sdk-kotlin-jvm/src/main/kotlin/com/immutable/sdk/Signer.kt).

Once you have a `Signer` instance you can generate the user's Stark key pair and use the result to implement a `StarkSigner`.
```kt
StarkKey.generate(signer).whenComplete { keyPair, error ->
    StarkKey.sign(keyPair, "0x5369676e2074686973")
}
```

## Autogenerated Code

Parts of the Core SDK are automagically generated.

### API Autogenerated Code

We use OpenAPI (formally known as Swagger) to auto-generate the API clients that connect to the public APIs.

The OpenAPI spec is retrieved from https://api.x.immutable.com/openapi and also saved in the repo [here](openapi.json).

When updating the `org.openapi.generator` plugin ensure that any custom templates are appropriately modified or removed. These can be found in the .openapi-generator/templates directory.

The generation always happens on preBuild so triggering a project build will regenerate them.
